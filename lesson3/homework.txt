Homework 3
===========

Level 1
--------

1. Write a program to generate list with all numbers divisible by 2 and 3
   between 1 and 10000 using two approaches:

    - list comprehension

    - filter function

2. Print a number of sentences in a file alice_in_wonderland.txt (a sentence
   shall end in either a dot . or a tripple-dot ...)

3. Write a script to convert strings to date objects. Input list:

    - 11 Jan 2016

    - 4 April 2011

    - 11.03.2014

    - 03/24/91

   Script should have defined supported dates formats. Conversion should be in
   the loop.


Level 2
--------

4. We need to decrease issues count and priority in
   Python for QA - bugs list - Sheet1.csv. Write a program to decrease each issue
   priority to one level (critical -> high, high -> medium, medium -> low),
   issues that have low level now should be removed. Save result into new CSV
   file.


5. Write a script to automatically generate directories and files (empty
   6 files with names task*.py where * is task number between 1 and 6)
   structure for python-for-qa course. Result should look the following way:

    - python-for-qa
        - lesson1
            - task1.py
             ...
            - task6.py
        - lesson2
            ...

6. Please figure out information from nginx access logs file - ``log.txt``:

    - all distinct requests' status codes

    - resources users tried to access without permissions (HTTP status 403)

    - created resources (HTTP status 201)

    - requests count in time range 15:11:00 - 15:26:00

    - successful requests rate (2xx / all count)
